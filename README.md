# CPP-Example08
C++ training example

Example created in Visual Studio 15 to support C++ training.
It contains examples of operator overload, reading and writing data from/to text files, static and dynamic casts, iterators, use of the Standard Template Library (STL), etc.
This code also demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming concepts like Composition, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

Ex08.cpp contains the "main()" method and was only implemented to this purpose.
The main class used in this example is "Gestor_Func" (see Gestor_Func.pp).
